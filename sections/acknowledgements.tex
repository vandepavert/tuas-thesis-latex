    \chapter*{Acknowledgements}
    It is a pleasure to thank those who supported me making this thesis possible.

    \paragraph{}
    I am thankful to my supervisor, Hazem Al-Bermanei, whose intricate
    knowledge of coding theory inspired me, and whose lectures, encouragement,
    and support enabled me to develop an understanding of this subject.

    \paragraph{}
    This thesis would not have been possible without the support of the teachers
    at the University of Applied Sciences and I would not have been able to even
    start these studies without the support and understanding of my wife, Maija
    and motivation from my children Kira, Caspar and Julius.

    \paragraph{}
    Last but certainly not least, I would like to express my gratitude to Aschwin
    van der Woude, for listening to my issues, for his advice and coaching.

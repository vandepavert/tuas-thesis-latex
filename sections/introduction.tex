\section{Error detection and correction}

When data is stored or transmitted, we cannot ignore encoding. The field of mathematics that deals with sending data, a digital bit stream, over a noisy channel is called coding theory. The Oxford English Dictionary says the following about code:

\begin{quote}
    Any system of symbols and rules for expressing information or instructions in a form usable by a computer or other machine for processing or transmitting information.
\end{quote}
